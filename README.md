# SwipeRecentApps
Swipe to kill recent apps for gingerbread

The src/com/tenten folder is for test purpose only. 
You can compile this and install like a normal app. 
Modifications can be made on src/com/tenten folder for tests

On src/com/android/internal/policy/impl, some codes differs from the test folder (tenten)

IMPORTANT:

libs must be included (nineoldandroids) otherwise, it will not work. (Bug about facebook crashing because of nineoldandroids)
